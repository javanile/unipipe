# 🚀 Unipipe: Universal Pipeline Standard

## 🌟 Introduction

Unipipe is a groundbreaking standard for CI/CD and development workflow automation that solves the fundamental challenges of existing pipeline management tools. Unlike traditional task runners or CI/CD platforms, Unipipe offers a truly portable, dependency-free, and platform-agnostic approach to defining and executing development workflows.

## 💡 The Problem Unipipe Solves

Current CI/CD tools suffer from critical limitations:
- Vendor lock-in
- Complex configuration files
- Limited portability
- Steep learning curves
- Inability to test pipelines locally

Unipipe eliminates these obstacles by introducing a simple, universal standard for pipeline definition and execution.

## ✨ Core Principles

- **Zero Dependencies**: Run anywhere, anytime
- **Pure Portability**: One script, multiple environments
- **Simplicity**: Human-readable, machine-executable
- **Platform Agnostic**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, and beyond

## 🛠 How Unipipe Works

### The unipipe.sh File

A minimal, POSIX-compliant shell script that defines your project's tasks:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

build() {
    echo "Building the project..."
    make
}

test() {
    echo "Running tests..."
    ./run-tests.sh
}

deploy() {
    echo "Deploying application..."
    scp app.tar.gz user@server:/deploy/
}
```

### Execution Flexibility

Run tasks locally or in CI/CD:

```sh
# Local execution
sh -c ". ./unipipe.sh && build"

# With unipipe client
unipipe build
unipipe test
unipipe deploy
```

## 🔌 Seamless CI/CD Integration

Generate configuration files for multiple platforms:

```sh
# Generate GitHub Actions workflow
unipipe --build github

# Generate GitLab CI configuration
unipipe --build gitlab
```

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any POSIX-compliant environment
- **Automatic CI/CD Configuration Generation**
- **Local and Remote Execution**
- **No Additional Dependencies**
- **Event and Conditional Support**
